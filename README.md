## Code Quiz

# Description

This webpage is a short quiz that has 5 easy questions relating to what we have learned so far, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I was motivated to do this project mainly to test my skills with JavaScript. Despite taking multiple days, this has been an important project to do because everything we have learned so far is combined on this project alone.
